TimThumb.php can be placed in any folder on your site. Upon install, it will automatically create a /cache/ subfolder which must be writable by the server. If your host server doesn't allow this by default, be sure to manually change the /cache/ folder permissions to 777.

TimThumb allows the following parameters:

*  src: location of file from doc root

*  w: width

*  h: height

*  zc: zoom crop (0 or 1)

*  q: quality (default is 75 and max is 100)

<img src="/scripts/timthumb.php?src=/images/image.jpg&h=150&w=150&zc=1" alt="" />
